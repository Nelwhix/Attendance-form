# ATTENDANCE-FORM
    for lack of a better name, this is what I have right now. The goal of this project is an app for recording student attendance then exporting records as csv's when needed

## Contributions
    To contribute, you need go 1.19.3 and a gcc compiler installed on your machine.

### TODO
- Finish working on the dashboard
- Allow updates
- add tests
- create a makeshift templating language to avoid repeating html
